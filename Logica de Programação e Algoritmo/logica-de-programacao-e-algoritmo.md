# Logic Programming

Everything we do follows a logical sequence.

Most of the time we don't realize this, but when we analyze our daily lives, we can understand how all our actions are the consequence of a chain of other smaller actions that led us to a final attitude.

Let's take the coffee we drink in the morning as an example.

When asked how we drink our coffee, most of us answer that when we wake up, we prepare the coffee with the help of an electric kettle, put it in a mug, and drink it.

But by unpacking this process, we are able to stipulate a sequence of steps that led to the final act of drinking this coffee. This sequence can be:

1. When I wake up, I get out of bed;
2. After getting out of bed, I go downstairs;
3. After going downstairs, I go into the kitchen;
4. After entering the kitchen, I grab the coffee powder from the cupboard;
5. After getting the coffee powder, I put it in the coffeepot;
6. After putting the powder in the coffeepot, I pour water into the specific compartment;
7. After inserting all the ingredients into the machine, I press the power button;
8. When the coffee is ready, I pick up the bottle;
9. After picking up the bottle, I pour the coffee into a mug;
10. After pouring the coffee into the mug, I drink the coffee.

Programming logic is the cohesive organization of a sequence of instructions aimed at solving a problem, or at creating a software program or application. The way of thinking logically to stipulate sequences of steps for solving a problem, we call programming logic; the narrative sequence of these events, we call an algorithm.

Programming logic is important because it gives us the tools necessary to perform the most basic process in the development of any application: the creation of its algorithm.


## The role of algorithms in programming logic

In programming, algorithms are a set of instructions that a piece of software or application must follow in order to perform a task, solve a problem, or reach a distinct goal. An algorithm, when executed using code that allows it to function with excellence, results in the resolution of a problem.
